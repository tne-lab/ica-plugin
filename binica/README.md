Compiled BINICA binaries in this folder are from this webpage of UCSD's Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience:
https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Binica

If you are using an architecture or operating system not represented here, such as FreeBSD or Sun Unix, you can obtain BINICA biniaries there. If there is no precompliled distribution to download, you can download the source code from the same page and compile from source.

Note that the Windows version included here is the "older version"; the newer one uses OpenMP and seems not to play well with being launched from the Open Ephys GUI.
 

As stated in the footer of the source webpage:

"**Important**: Infomax ICA is under a patent by the Salk Institute and any commercial product using this type of algorithm (or the recompiled binary files distributed here) should contact the Salk Institute patent office."
